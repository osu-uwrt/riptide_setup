# Bringup

This package only contains launch files used for launching our vehicle. We have launch files for running the entire system at competition, testing individual features \(such as controlling the vehicle's attitude from the acoustics system\), running the vehicle as controlled via PS3 controller and with YOLO output, etc.

## Launch Files \(launch/\)

This folder stores all of the launch files. The `be_autonomous.launch` file launched the entire system for the RoboSub 2018 competition.
